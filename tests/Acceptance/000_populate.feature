Feature: 
In order to perfom tests
As a generic user of the app
I want to see data be initalised in the database

Scenario:
 When I add.... 
 Then I see "Winter camp", "Summer camp" and "Spring camp" in the database camps
 And I see "VIP", "Basic" and "Premium" in the database memberships
 Then I see "half court", "full court" and "basket" in the database booking type
